# Audiobook Pipeline

This repository uses voices which can be obtained from [piper-voices](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/v1.0.0).
To use a certain voice, download respective `.onnx` and `.onnx.json` files (and place them next to each other) and pass the path to the `.onnx` file using the `--model-dir` parameter.
